AchievementPacks
================

This is the new version of the TandMMap's Achievement Packs.

================

It is now an API and a mod, in one. There are two ways to use the mod, as a **DEVELOPER** or a **PLAYER**.


Chances are: you're a player. If you are using this as a player, head to the **Releases** tab above this. There, you can find the version you need for the mod.

If you are a developer, see the next section!
